# Some ideas i want to bring to life at some point

- [ ] **Library of Babel**. Random cartridge generator with a seed that can be
  copied and pasted to replicate this random cartridge again

- [ ] **Human-readable cartridge view**. It would be cool to add ability to view
  the cartridge data as human-readable "assembly" code
