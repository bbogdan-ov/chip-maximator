# Blender project

The models and animations of CHIP MAXIMATOR are right here!

It may not be optimized well, many texture are procedurally generated,
resolution of textures is high and meshes are pretty high-poly, so be ready.
But my laptop's integrated GPU handles it pretty well

Most materials and textures are taken from [https://ambientcg.com],
thank you soo much!!!
