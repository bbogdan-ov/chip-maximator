# ROMs (read-only memory files)

CHIP-8 games themselves!!

Collection of pairs of ROM (`example.ch8`) and its description (`example.txt`)

Most of ROMs were taken from here:

- [https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms]
- [https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo] (a cool ide for creating CHIP-8 games btw)

## P.S
